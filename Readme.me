#Portfolio

26/01/2021

This repository is for me to demonstrate my abilities to potential employers and collaborators.

My learning includes C#, MySql, Dotnet, machine learning and I am currently focusing on python.

My latest project is an app to create invoices in the InvoiceCreator3 folder. This is written
in python. It utilises Tkinter to input the required information and produces a pdf file of the
invoice.
