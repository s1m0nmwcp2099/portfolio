C#, MySql, ML.NET
This program takes football result data from a MySql database. After initially
updating the database with csv files from http://football-data.co.uk it takes all previous scores and produces a time-weighted calculation
of average goals scored and conceded and win, draw and loss percentages going into each match which are separated by home and away.
It then uses a machine learning model generated by ML.NET CLI which is designed to predict the probability of a home win, draw and away win.
The previous procedure for calculating average goals and win, draw and loss percentages is repeated for the most up to date fixtures which are also 
downloaded from http://football-date.co.uk.
The machine learning model is applied to calculate the probability of each outcome. These probabilities are compared with the bookmaker odds to
spot value bets.
